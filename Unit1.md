    Study this example situation:

    Sarah is in her car. She is on her way to work. She is driving to work.
    This means: she is driving now, at the time of spaking. The action is not finished.

    Am/is/are+ -ing is the present continuous:
    i             am(=i'm)            driving
    he/she/it     is(=he's etc)       working
    we/you/they   are(=we're etc)     doing etc.

    I am doing something = I'm in the middle of doing it; I've started doing it and I haven't finished:

        Please don't make so much noise. I'm trying to work. 
        'Where's Mark?' 'He's having a shower'.
        Let's go out now. It isn't raining any more.
        (at a party)Hi,Jane. Are you enjoying the party?
        What's all that noise? What's going on? (=What's happening)

    Sometimes the action is not happening at the time of speaking. For example:

        Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says:
        I'm reading a really good book at the moment. It's about man who ...
    
    Steve is not reading the book at the time of speaking. 
    He means that he has started it. but has not finished it yet.

    Some more examples:
    Kate wants to work in Italy. so she's learning Italian.(But perhaps she isn't learning Italian at the time of speaking)
    Some friends of mine are building their own house. They hope to finish it next summer.
